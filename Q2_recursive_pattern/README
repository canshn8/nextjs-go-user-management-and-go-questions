Q2: Recursive Pattern
Problem Description:
Create a recursive pattern that prints numbers in a specific sequence. The pattern starts at 9, prints 9, then moves to 4, prints 4, then moves to 2, and stops.

Solution Explanation:
Start with the number 9.
Print the number, and recursively call the next number in the pattern.
Base case is when the number reaches 2, at which point the recursion stops.
